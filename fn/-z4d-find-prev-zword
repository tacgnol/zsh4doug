# Usage: -z4d-find-prev-zword
#
# Sets reply=(START END) such that BUFFER[START,END] contains the shell word
# that the cursor is on, or the previous shell word if the cursor is on
# whitespace. If there are no shell words in $PREBUFFER$BUFFER, return 1
# without setting reply. START and END can be non-positive, which means that
# a part of the shell word is in PREBUFFER.
